Run these commands with Git Bash from the root folder of the repository

When you're starting work on something new
- git branch <name>
- git checkout <name>
- <make changes>
<name> should identify what you're working on and be easy to type.

To incorporate any changes to the Master branch (you should do this before each coding session)
- git checkout master
- git pull
- git checkout <name>
- git rebase master
Note: Rebase will change your current branch to stem from the specified branch.
	So, we update master first
		Then checkout <name> so it's the current branch
		Then the rebase command will change <name> to stem from master
	Don'T checkout master, then rebase <name>

When you're ready to commit changes to your branch (you should do this for major changes
	or at the end of a coding session, but probably not for minor things)
- git add <files being comitted>
- git commit -m "<commit message here>"
- git push

When you're ready to add your new thing to Master; do this when youre thing is done,
	don't do this with in-progress code
- <Make sure all changes have been comitted to the branch first>
- git checkout master
- git merge <name>
- git push

If youre having permission problems, run
- bash tools/permscript.sh
